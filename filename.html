    	<b>Every paragraph in the body &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of an essay consists of three main parts: a topic sentence,</b><br><i> some supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence.</i>  <u> Transition words and phrases provide links between individual paragraphs, and so are important to consider, as well.</u> 
    	<b>A clear topic sentence in each paragraph will assist with essay organization.</b> <i> Consider writing topic sentences early in the</i> 
    	<s>process, while youâ€™re working on an outline.  You can return later to</s> fill in the rest of the paragraph. <u> Having these single sentences figured out early makes the rest of the essay much easier to write! </u> <b>	Devote each body paragraph of an essay to discussing only the point of its topic sentence.</b> <i> If something is interesting to you, but not directly related to the topic sentence, save it for elsewhere in the essay (or hang on to it for a future writing task!).</i><u> This will help keep your essay focused and effective.</u>
